Here is some quality of life programs for making Bezier curves on Desmos. 
Run BezierQOL.py, because that is the important file. 

For info on how to implement equations, look at this example: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/y53w3ibg7f

NOTE: The more iterations you do, the more inaccurate the equations get (More Issues listed in notes on Desmos example).
